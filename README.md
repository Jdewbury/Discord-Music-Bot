# Discord-Music-Bot

Discord bot that is capable of joining channels and playing user-requested music by downloading songs from YouTube. 

Once the first song is queued and played, the bot utilizes web scraping to analyze the most prominent music keys present within the song, and then proceeds to queue an entire playlist of songs that also contain that prominent note. Provides users with a playlist of songs with similar 'vibes'.
